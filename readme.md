# Hashtags for Humans

Exploring the relationship between tags, mathematical sets, and notions of identity

# installation
`npm install`

# running
`npm start`

# Introduction: Guess Who?
- maybe don't even play the game? have two computer players against each other go very quickly
- what faces do i use? **emoji?**

# Interlude: History of Hashtags

## Web 2.0
- tags vs categories in blogs
    + tag clouds
- folksonomy
    + tags in communities

## Social Web (Twitter/Tumblr/Instagram)
- tag as channel marker / trending topic
- tag as idiom, even in conversation (Still drunk from last night! #hotmess)
- exhaustive tagging (instagram)
- tag as footnote (tumblr-style sentence tags)

# Demo: Reverse Guess Who?
- you know who it is and you need to come up with an unambiguous description
- again, but with multiple people to select
- use s-expression style builder with set operators (union, difference, intersection)

# Interlude: Tags as Mathematical Sets
- presence of tag in a record indicates membership in a set
- extremely brief explanation of set theory
- databases / relational algebra
    + LIMIT 1 means 1-item set, not a bare record
- css selectors
    + tag name as shared vocabulary, class as personal vocabulary
    + emphasis on semantic tags/classes
    + jquery object as set (always a set, never a bare record)
- third thing? maybe app's implemntation in pouchDB?

# Conclusion: Thinking in Tags

## Guess Who: Visible & Invisible identity
- weâ€™ve been playing guess who with these people, but they all have rich inner lives that contribute to their identity
- game board cells expand to show little bios of people

## Category Culture vs Tag Culture
- our culture thinks a lot about categories but not about tags
    + "what are you" as a question expecting a single answer 
    + political parties 
    + failures of progressive movements -> intersectionality
- cultures that live online (e.g. tumblr) embrace ambiguity, heterodoxy, multiple identity
    + mythology of "SJW" as a bloc but there are many different persepectives
    + even the most mocked aspects of internet culture (headmates, otherkin, paragraph sexuality) are just a product of young people who think in tags trying to exist in a category-oriented culture
