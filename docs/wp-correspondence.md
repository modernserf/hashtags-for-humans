Hi Matt. I'm working on a talk about how the paradigms of categorization and tagging affect culture. WordPress is particularly interesting to me because it's been used for such a wide variety of use cases, and it natively supports both paradigms, as well as blurring the lines between them, e.g. posts having multiple categories. Here are my questions:

- Categorization was present in WP 1.0, but tags weren't built-in until 2.3 in 2007. Was there a particular goal towards blessing a tagging system, or was it more of a "paving the cowpaths" thing?
- What kinds of authors tend to favor categorization vs tagging? Do you see detailed hierarchies as often as you see large tag vocabularies?
- How does the usage of taxonomies differ between single-author blogs and larger publications?
- Have you seen shifts in the usage of categories vs tags over time?
- Do different kinds of taxonomies lend themselves better to different kinds of media? i.e. is Matt's Community Tags focused on photos because those lend themselves to tagging more readily than prose does?
- What has surprised you the most about how user-generated taxonomy has evolved? When did you first encounter category/tag names used as parenthetical commentary?
- Tags on Instagram and Tumblr are conceptually very similar to tags in WP, but Twitter hashtags have a distinct culture around them. Do you consider this to just be how categories/tags work in a limited medium, or is it a new and independent taxonomical form?
