I think you should hit these points: 1) categories vs. tags as ways of thinking about things 2) how each falls short 3) how software outwardly (hashtags) reflects this tug of war and 4) how software inwardly (CSS selectors) reflects this tug of war

> I don't like the part about political parties 
And I think you shouldn't gloss over all the stuff about the downsides of identity politics we were talking about last weekend
I think it was when we were talking about policing of queer identity
How if you make your movement about visible identity, you end up policing the boundaries more than fighting the power structure
And It becomes focused on definition of identity

I'm not sure how to discuss intersectionality without "talking out of school" -- i don't feel qualified to instruct people about feminism or sexual identity in any significant detail. id like some sort of intersectionality example that's more immediately gemane -- maybe i start with "programmers" as a category, and then break it down first by "safe" properties -- e.g. stack -- and how their experiences can be wildly different and they have different community needs; then break down by gender/race/class etc and the intersectionalities therein. 

And programmers have intense boundary policing about the most asinine stuff -- tabs vs spaces, vim vs emacs, etc. and "best practices" are more often than not as rooted in tradition and accidents of history as any political ideology?
But now this feels obvious again

> I also think what you have right rings a little of "the world would be a better place if we were just a bit more accepting of everyone's individuality"
you should go more in the direction of how might these new ways of thinking support inclusive and intersectional movements
rather than just allow us to know each other better
Maybe precisely because they subvert  boundary policing through hyper-specificity
Or do they create limitations on that kind of movement building? In which case you could just sort of conclude with a how do we shift how they're being used?
