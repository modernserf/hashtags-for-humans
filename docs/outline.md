# Introduction
## Definition
A hashtag is a member of a vocabulary of categorization that is:
- vernacular: tags are created by usage, not by authority
- relational: an item in a collection can have multiple tags; having a hashtag is analogous to set membership
- conversational: the members of a tag set, projected over time, constitute a stream; a hashtag can be used as a channel of communication

## Thesis
Hashtags have popularized a paradigm of thought that allows for more complex notions of identity than hierarchies. 

# Categorization
## hierarchy vs keywords (relational)
- history: library of congress
- set theory via Guess Who?
- OO paradigms:

## web 2.0 (vernacular)
- history
- folksonomy & downsides therein
- solutions
    + fixed hierarchy, open tags
        * wordpress, metafilter
        * css selectors
    + tag suggestion
        * facebook gender selector
    + community pedantry (semi-regulated vocabulary) 
## channels
- history (where the hashtag got its hash)
- real-time vs offline, irc vs newsgroups
- patterns for tag searches
- tumblr tags as community anchors
- twitter inherits traits from both

# Cultural impact
- vernacular: hashtag as a neologism, hashtag as idiom
- relational: hashtag as metaphor of intersectionality
- conversational: hashtag as metonym for social movement
